## Voting

The following contract is quite complex, but showcases a lot of
Solidity\'s features. It implements a voting contract. Of course, the
main problems of electronic voting is how to assign voting rights to the
correct persons and how to prevent manipulation. We will not solve all
problems here, but at least we will show how delegated voting can be
done so that vote counting is **automatic and completely transparent**
at the same time.

The idea is to create one contract per ballot, providing a short name
for each option. Then the creator of the contract who serves as
chairperson will give the right to vote to each address individually.

The persons behind the addresses can then choose to either vote
themselves or to delegate their vote to a person they trust.

At the end of the voting time, `winningProposal()` will return the
proposal with the largest number of votes.

### Possible Improvements

Currently, many transactions are needed to assign the rights to vote to
all participants. Can you think of a better way?

## Blind Auction

In this section, we will show how easy it is to create a completely
blind auction contract on Ethereum. We will start with an open auction
where everyone can see the bids that are made and then extend this
contract into a blind auction where it is not possible to see the actual
bid until the bidding period ends.

### Simple Open Auction {#simple_auction}

The general idea of the following simple auction contract is that
everyone can send their bids during a bidding period. The bids already
include sending money / Ether in order to bind the bidders to their bid.
If the highest bid is raised, the previous highest bidder gets their
money back. After the end of the bidding period, the contract has to be
called manually for the beneficiary to receive their money - contracts
cannot activate themselves.

``` solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0
pragma solidity ^0.8.4;
contract SimpleAuction {
    // Parameters of the auction. Times are either
    // absolute unix timestamps (seconds since 1970-01-01)
    // or time periods in seconds.
    address payable public beneficiary;
    uint public auctionEndTime;

    // Current state of the auction.
    address public highestBidder;
    uint public highestBid;

    // Allowed withdrawals of previous bids
    mapping(address => uint) pendingReturns;

    // Set to true at the end, disallows any change.
    // By default initialized to `false`.
    bool ended;

    // Events that will be emitted on changes.
    event HighestBidIncreased(address bidder, uint amount);
    event AuctionEnded(address winner, uint amount);

    // Errors that describe failures.

    // The triple-slash comments are so-called natspec
    // comments. They will be shown when the user
    // is asked to confirm a transaction or
    // when an error is displayed.

    /// The auction has already ended.
    error AuctionAlreadyEnded();
    /// There is already a higher or equal bid.
    error BidNotHighEnough(uint highestBid);
    /// The auction has not ended yet.
    error AuctionNotYetEnded();
    /// The function auctionEnd has already been called.
    error AuctionEndAlreadyCalled();

    /// Create a simple auction with `biddingTime`
    /// seconds bidding time on behalf of the
    /// beneficiary address `beneficiaryAddress`.
    constructor(
        uint biddingTime,
        address payable beneficiaryAddress
    ) {
        beneficiary = beneficiaryAddress;
        auctionEndTime = block.timestamp + biddingTime;
    }

    /// Bid on the auction with the value sent
    /// together with this transaction.
    /// The value will only be refunded if the
    /// auction is not won.
    function bid() external payable {
        // No arguments are necessary, all
        // information is already part of
        // the transaction. The keyword payable
        // is required for the function to
        // be able to receive Ether.

        // Revert the call if the bidding
        // period is over.
        if (block.timestamp > auctionEndTime)
            revert AuctionAlreadyEnded();

        // If the bid is not higher, send the
        // money back (the revert statement
        // will revert all changes in this
        // function execution including
        // it having received the money).
        if (msg.value <= highestBid)
            revert BidNotHighEnough(highestBid);

        if (highestBid != 0) {
            // Sending back the money by simply using
            // highestBidder.send(highestBid) is a security risk
            // because it could execute an untrusted contract.
            // It is always safer to let the recipients
            // withdraw their money themselves.
            pendingReturns[highestBidder] += highestBid;
        }
        highestBidder = msg.sender;
        highestBid = msg.value;
        emit HighestBidIncreased(msg.sender, msg.value);
    }

    /// Withdraw a bid that was overbid.
    function withdraw() external returns (bool) {
        uint amount = pendingReturns[msg.sender];
        if (amount > 0) {
            // It is important to set this to zero because the recipient
            // can call this function again as part of the receiving call
            // before `send` returns.
            pendingReturns[msg.sender] = 0;

            // msg.sender is not of type `address payable` and must be
            // explicitly converted using `payable(msg.sender)` in order
            // use the member function `send()`.
            if (!payable(msg.sender).send(amount)) {
                // No need to call throw here, just reset the amount owing
                pendingReturns[msg.sender] = amount;
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }

    /// to the beneficiary.
    function auctionEnd() external {
        // It is a good guideline to structure functions that interact
        // with other contracts (i.e. they call functions or send Ether)
        // into three phases:
        // 1. checking conditions
        // 2. performing actions (potentially changing conditions)
        // 3. interacting with other contracts
        // If these phases are mixed up, the other contract could call
        // back into the current contract and modify the state or cause
        // effects (ether payout) to be performed multiple times.
        // If functions called internally include interaction with external
        // contracts, they also have to be considered interaction with
        // external contracts.

        // 1. Conditions
        if (block.timestamp < auctionEndTime)
            revert AuctionNotYetEnded();
        if (ended)
            revert AuctionEndAlreadyCalled();

        // 2. Effects
        ended = true;
        emit AuctionEnded(highestBidder, highestBid);

        // 3. Interaction
        beneficiary.transfer(highestBid);
    }
}
```

### Blind Auction

The previous open auction is extended to a blind auction in the
following. The advantage of a blind auction is that there is no time
pressure towards the end of the bidding period. Creating a blind auction
on a transparent computing platform might sound like a contradiction,
but cryptography comes to the rescue.

During the **bidding period**, a bidder does not actually send their
bid, but only a hashed version of it. Since it is currently considered
practically impossible to find two (sufficiently long) values whose hash
values are equal, the bidder commits to the bid by that. After the end
of the bidding period, the bidders have to reveal their bids: They send
their values unencrypted and the contract checks that the hash value is
the same as the one provided during the bidding period.

Another challenge is how to make the auction **binding and blind** at
the same time: The only way to prevent the bidder from just not sending
the money after they won the auction is to make them send it together
with the bid. Since value transfers cannot be blinded in Ethereum,
anyone can see the value.

The following contract solves this problem by accepting any value that
is larger than the highest bid. Since this can of course only be checked
during the reveal phase, some bids might be **invalid**, and this is on
purpose (it even provides an explicit flag to place invalid bids with
high value transfers): Bidders can confuse competition by placing
several high or low invalid bids.

## Safe Remote Purchase

Purchasing goods remotely currently requires multiple parties that need
to trust each other. The simplest configuration involves a seller and a
buyer. The buyer would like to receive an item from the seller and the
seller would like to get money (or an equivalent) in return. The
problematic part is the shipment here: There is no way to determine for
sure that the item arrived at the buyer.

There are multiple ways to solve this problem, but all fall short in one
or the other way. In the following example, both parties have to put
twice the value of the item into the contract as escrow. As soon as this
happened, the money will stay locked inside the contract until the buyer
confirms that they received the item. After that, the buyer is returned
the value (half of their deposit) and the seller gets three times the
value (their deposit plus the value). The idea behind this is that both
parties have an incentive to resolve the situation or otherwise their
money is locked forever.

This contract of course does not solve the problem, but gives an
overview of how you can use state machine-like constructs inside a
contract.

## Micropayment Channel

In this section we will learn how to build an example implementation of
a payment channel. It uses cryptographic signatures to make repeated
transfers of Ether between the same parties secure, instantaneous, and
without transaction fees. For the example, we need to understand how to
sign and verify signatures, and setup the payment channel.

### Creating and verifying signatures

Imagine Alice wants to send some Ether to Bob, i.e. Alice is the sender
and Bob is the recipient.

Alice only needs to send cryptographically signed messages off-chain
(e.g. via email) to Bob and it is similar to writing checks.

Alice and Bob use signatures to authorise transactions, which is
possible with smart contracts on Ethereum. Alice will build a simple
smart contract that lets her transmit Ether, but instead of calling a
function herself to initiate a payment, she will let Bob do that, and
therefore pay the transaction fee.

The contract will work as follows:

> 1.  Alice deploys the `ReceiverPays` contract, attaching enough Ether
>     to cover the payments that will be made.
> 2.  Alice authorises a payment by signing a message with her private
>     key.
> 3.  Alice sends the cryptographically signed message to Bob. The
>     message does not need to be kept secret (explained later), and the
>     mechanism for sending it does not matter.
> 4.  Bob claims his payment by presenting the signed message to the
>     smart contract, it verifies the authenticity of the message and
>     then releases the funds.

#### Creating the signature

Alice does not need to interact with the Ethereum network to sign the
transaction, the process is completely offline. In this tutorial, we
will sign messages in the browser using
[web3.js](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js) and
[MetaMask](https://metamask.io), using the method described in
[EIP-712](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/712), as it provides a
number of other security benefits.

``` javascript
/// Hashing first makes things easier
var hash = web3.utils.sha3("message to sign");
web3.eth.personal.sign(hash, web3.eth.defaultAccount, function () { console.log("Signed"); });
```

::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The `web3.eth.personal.sign` prepends the length of the message to the
signed data. Since we hash first, the message will always be exactly 32
bytes long, and thus this length prefix is always the same.
:::

#### What to Sign

For a contract that fulfils payments, the signed message must include:

> 1.  The recipient\'s address.
> 2.  The amount to be transferred.
> 3.  Protection against replay attacks.

A replay attack is when a signed message is reused to claim
authorization for a second action. To avoid replay attacks we use the
same technique as in Ethereum transactions themselves, a so-called
nonce, which is the number of transactions sent by an account. The smart
contract checks if a nonce is used multiple times.

Another type of replay attack can occur when the owner deploys a
`ReceiverPays` smart contract, makes some payments, and then destroys
the contract. Later, they decide to deploy the `RecipientPays` smart
contract again, but the new contract does not know the nonces used in
the previous deployment, so the attacker can use the old messages again.

Alice can protect against this attack by including the contract\'s
address in the message, and only messages containing the contract\'s
address itself will be accepted. You can find an example of this in the
first two lines of the `claimPayment()` function of the full contract at
the end of this section.

#### Packing arguments

Now that we have identified what information to include in the signed
message, we are ready to put the message together, hash it, and sign it.
For simplicity, we concatenate the data. The
[ethereumjs-abi](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-abi) library
provides a function called `soliditySHA3` that mimics the behaviour of
Solidity\'s `keccak256` function applied to arguments encoded using
`abi.encodePacked`. Here is a JavaScript function that creates the
proper signature for the `ReceiverPays` example:

``` javascript
// recipient is the address that should be paid.
// amount, in wei, specifies how much ether should be sent.
// nonce can be any unique number to prevent replay attacks
// contractAddress is used to prevent cross-contract replay attacks
function signPayment(recipient, amount, nonce, contractAddress, callback) {
    var hash = "0x" + abi.soliditySHA3(
        ["address", "uint256", "uint256", "address"],
        [recipient, amount, nonce, contractAddress]
    ).toString("hex");

    web3.eth.personal.sign(hash, web3.eth.defaultAccount, callback);
}
```

#### Recovering the Message Signer in Solidity

In general, ECDSA signatures consist of two parameters, `r` and `s`.
Signatures in Ethereum include a third parameter called `v`, that you
can use to verify which account\'s private key was used to sign the
message, and the transaction\'s sender. Solidity provides a built-in
function
`ecrecover <mathematical-and-cryptographic-functions>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} that accepts a message along with the `r`, `s` and `v`
parameters and returns the address that was used to sign the message.

#### Extracting the Signature Parameters

Signatures produced by web3.js are the concatenation of `r`, `s` and
`v`, so the first step is to split these parameters apart. You can do
this on the client-side, but doing it inside the smart contract means
you only need to send one signature parameter rather than three.
Splitting apart a byte array into its constituent parts is a mess, so we
use `inline assembly <assembly>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} to do the
job in the `splitSignature` function (the third function in the full
contract at the end of this section).

#### Computing the Message Hash

The smart contract needs to know exactly what parameters were signed,
and so it must recreate the message from the parameters and use that for
signature verification. The functions `prefixed` and `recoverSigner` do
this in the `claimPayment` function.

#### The full contract

``` {.solidity force=""}
// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0
pragma solidity >=0.7.0 <0.9.0;
contract ReceiverPays {
    address owner = msg.sender;

    mapping(uint256 => bool) usedNonces;

    constructor() payable {}

    function claimPayment(uint256 amount, uint256 nonce, bytes memory signature) external {
        require(!usedNonces[nonce]);
        usedNonces[nonce] = true;

        // this recreates the message that was signed on the client
        bytes32 message = prefixed(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(msg.sender, amount, nonce, this)));

        require(recoverSigner(message, signature) == owner);

        payable(msg.sender).transfer(amount);
    }

    /// destroy the contract and reclaim the leftover funds.
    function shutdown() external {
        require(msg.sender == owner);
        selfdestruct(payable(msg.sender));
    }

    /// signature methods.
    function splitSignature(bytes memory sig)
        internal
        pure
        returns (uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s)
    {
        require(sig.length == 65);

        assembly {
            // first 32 bytes, after the length prefix.
            r := mload(add(sig, 32))
            // second 32 bytes.
            s := mload(add(sig, 64))
            // final byte (first byte of the next 32 bytes).
            v := byte(0, mload(add(sig, 96)))
        }

        return (v, r, s);
    }

    function recoverSigner(bytes32 message, bytes memory sig)
        internal
        pure
        returns (address)
    {
        (uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) = splitSignature(sig);

        return ecrecover(message, v, r, s);
    }

    /// builds a prefixed hash to mimic the behavior of eth_sign.
    function prefixed(bytes32 hash) internal pure returns (bytes32) {
        return keccak256(abi.encodePacked("\x19Ethereum Signed Message:\n32", hash));
    }
}
```

### Writing a Simple Payment Channel

Alice now builds a simple but complete implementation of a payment
channel. Payment channels use cryptographic signatures to make repeated
transfers of Ether securely, instantaneously, and without transaction
fees.

#### What is a Payment Channel?

Payment channels allow participants to make repeated transfers of Ether
without using transactions. This means that you can avoid the delays and
fees associated with transactions. We are going to explore a simple
unidirectional payment channel between two parties (Alice and Bob). It
involves three steps:

> 1.  Alice funds a smart contract with Ether. This \"opens\" the
>     payment channel.
> 2.  Alice signs messages that specify how much of that Ether is owed
>     to the recipient. This step is repeated for each payment.
> 3.  Bob \"closes\" the payment channel, withdrawing his portion of the
>     Ether and sending the remainder back to the sender.

::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Only steps 1 and 3 require Ethereum transactions, step 2 means that the
sender transmits a cryptographically signed message to the recipient via
off chain methods (e.g. email). This means only two transactions are
required to support any number of transfers.
:::

Bob is guaranteed to receive his funds because the smart contract
escrows the Ether and honours a valid signed message. The smart contract
also enforces a timeout, so Alice is guaranteed to eventually recover
her funds even if the recipient refuses to close the channel. It is up
to the participants in a payment channel to decide how long to keep it
open. For a short-lived transaction, such as paying an internet café for
each minute of network access, the payment channel may be kept open for
a limited duration. On the other hand, for a recurring payment, such as
paying an employee an hourly wage, the payment channel may be kept open
for several months or years.

#### Opening the Payment Channel

To open the payment channel, Alice deploys the smart contract, attaching
the Ether to be escrowed and specifying the intended recipient and a
maximum duration for the channel to exist. This is the function
`SimplePaymentChannel` in the contract, at the end of this section.

#### Making Payments

Alice makes payments by sending signed messages to Bob. This step is
performed entirely outside of the Ethereum network. Messages are
cryptographically signed by the sender and then transmitted directly to
the recipient.

Each message includes the following information:

> -   The smart contract\'s address, used to prevent cross-contract
>     replay attacks.
> -   The total amount of Ether that is owed the recipient so far.

A payment channel is closed just once, at the end of a series of
transfers. Because of this, only one of the messages sent is redeemed.
This is why each message specifies a cumulative total amount of Ether
owed, rather than the amount of the individual micropayment. The
recipient will naturally choose to redeem the most recent message
because that is the one with the highest total. The nonce per-message is
not needed anymore, because the smart contract only honours a single
message. The address of the smart contract is still used to prevent a
message intended for one payment channel from being used for a different
channel.

Here is the modified JavaScript code to cryptographically sign a message
from the previous section:

``` javascript
function constructPaymentMessage(contractAddress, amount) {
    return abi.soliditySHA3(
        ["address", "uint256"],
        [contractAddress, amount]
    );
}

function signMessage(message, callback) {
    web3.eth.personal.sign(
        "0x" + message.toString("hex"),
        web3.eth.defaultAccount,
        callback
    );
}

// contractAddress is used to prevent cross-contract replay attacks.
// amount, in wei, specifies how much Ether should be sent.

function signPayment(contractAddress, amount, callback) {
    var message = constructPaymentMessage(contractAddress, amount);
    signMessage(message, callback);
}
```

#### Closing the Payment Channel

When Bob is ready to receive his funds, it is time to close the payment
channel by calling a `close` function on the smart contract. Closing the
channel pays the recipient the Ether they are owed and destroys the
contract, sending any remaining Ether back to Alice. To close the
channel, Bob needs to provide a message signed by Alice.

The smart contract must verify that the message contains a valid
signature from the sender. The process for doing this verification is
the same as the process the recipient uses. The Solidity functions
`isValidSignature` and `recoverSigner` work just like their JavaScript
counterparts in the previous section, with the latter function borrowed
from the `ReceiverPays` contract.

Only the payment channel recipient can call the `close` function, who
naturally passes the most recent payment message because that message
carries the highest total owed. If the sender were allowed to call this
function, they could provide a message with a lower amount and cheat the
recipient out of what they are owed.

The function verifies the signed message matches the given parameters.
If everything checks out, the recipient is sent their portion of the
Ether, and the sender is sent the rest via a `selfdestruct`. You can see
the `close` function in the full contract.

#### Channel Expiration

Bob can close the payment channel at any time, but if they fail to do
so, Alice needs a way to recover her escrowed funds. An *expiration*
time was set at the time of contract deployment. Once that time is
reached, Alice can call `claimTimeout` to recover her funds. You can see
the `claimTimeout` function in the full contract.

After this function is called, Bob can no longer receive any Ether, so
it is important that Bob closes the channel before the expiration is
reached.

#### The full contract

``` {.solidity force=""}
// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0
pragma solidity >=0.7.0 <0.9.0;
contract SimplePaymentChannel {
    address payable public sender;      // The account sending payments.
    address payable public recipient;   // The account receiving the payments.
    uint256 public expiration;  // Timeout in case the recipient never closes.

    constructor (address payable recipientAddress, uint256 duration)
        payable
    {
        sender = payable(msg.sender);
        recipient = recipientAddress;
        expiration = block.timestamp + duration;
    }

    /// the recipient can close the channel at any time by presenting a
    /// signed amount from the sender. the recipient will be sent that amount,
    /// and the remainder will go back to the sender
    function close(uint256 amount, bytes memory signature) external {
        require(msg.sender == recipient);
        require(isValidSignature(amount, signature));

        recipient.transfer(amount);
        selfdestruct(sender);
    }

    /// the sender can extend the expiration at any time
    function extend(uint256 newExpiration) external {
        require(msg.sender == sender);
        require(newExpiration > expiration);

        expiration = newExpiration;
    }

    /// if the timeout is reached without the recipient closing the channel,
    /// then the Ether is released back to the sender.
    function claimTimeout() external {
        require(block.timestamp >= expiration);
        selfdestruct(sender);
    }

    function isValidSignature(uint256 amount, bytes memory signature)
        internal
        view
        returns (bool)
    {
        bytes32 message = prefixed(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(this, amount)));

        // check that the signature is from the payment sender
        return recoverSigner(message, signature) == sender;
    }

    /// All functions below this are just taken from the chapter
    /// 'creating and verifying signatures' chapter.

    function splitSignature(bytes memory sig)
        internal
        pure
        returns (uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s)
    {
        require(sig.length == 65);

        assembly {
            // first 32 bytes, after the length prefix
            r := mload(add(sig, 32))
            // second 32 bytes
            s := mload(add(sig, 64))
            // final byte (first byte of the next 32 bytes)
            v := byte(0, mload(add(sig, 96)))
        }

        return (v, r, s);
    }

    function recoverSigner(bytes32 message, bytes memory sig)
        internal
        pure
        returns (address)
    {
        (uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) = splitSignature(sig);

        return ecrecover(message, v, r, s);
    }

    /// builds a prefixed hash to mimic the behavior of eth_sign.
    function prefixed(bytes32 hash) internal pure returns (bytes32) {
        return keccak256(abi.encodePacked("\x19Ethereum Signed Message:\n32", hash));
    }
}
```

::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The function `splitSignature` does not use all security checks. A real
implementation should use a more rigorously tested library, such as
openzepplin\'s
[version](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/utils/cryptography/ECDSA.sol)
of this code.
:::

#### Verifying Payments

Unlike in the previous section, messages in a payment channel aren\'t
redeemed right away. The recipient keeps track of the latest message and
redeems it when it\'s time to close the payment channel. This means
it\'s critical that the recipient perform their own verification of each
message. Otherwise there is no guarantee that the recipient will be able
to get paid in the end.

The recipient should verify each message using the following process:

> 1.  Verify that the contract address in the message matches the
>     payment channel.
> 2.  Verify that the new total is the expected amount.
> 3.  Verify that the new total does not exceed the amount of Ether
>     escrowed.
> 4.  Verify that the signature is valid and comes from the payment
>     channel sender.

We\'ll use the
[ethereumjs-util](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-util) library
to write this verification. The final step can be done a number of ways,
and we use JavaScript. The following code borrows the
`constructPaymentMessage` function from the signing **JavaScript code**
above:

``` javascript
// this mimics the prefixing behavior of the eth_sign JSON-RPC method.
function prefixed(hash) {
    return ethereumjs.ABI.soliditySHA3(
        ["string", "bytes32"],
        ["\x19Ethereum Signed Message:\n32", hash]
    );
}

function recoverSigner(message, signature) {
    var split = ethereumjs.Util.fromRpcSig(signature);
    var publicKey = ethereumjs.Util.ecrecover(message, split.v, split.r, split.s);
    var signer = ethereumjs.Util.pubToAddress(publicKey).toString("hex");
    return signer;
}

function isValidSignature(contractAddress, amount, signature, expectedSigner) {
    var message = prefixed(constructPaymentMessage(contractAddress, amount));
    var signer = recoverSigner(message, signature);
    return signer.toLowerCase() ==
        ethereumjs.Util.stripHexPrefix(expectedSigner).toLowerCase();
}
```

## Modular Contracts

A modular approach to building your contracts helps you reduce the
complexity and improve the readability which will help to identify bugs
and vulnerabilities during development and code review. If you specify
and control the behaviour or each module in isolation, the interactions
you have to consider are only those between the module specifications
and not every other moving part of the contract. In the example below,
the contract uses the `move` method of the `Balances`
`library <libraries>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} to check that
balances sent between addresses match what you expect. In this way, the
`Balances` library provides an isolated component that properly tracks
balances of accounts. It is easy to verify that the `Balances` library
never produces negative balances or overflows and the sum of all
balances is an invariant across the lifetime of the contract.

``` solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0
pragma solidity >=0.5.0 <0.9.0;

library Balances {
    function move(mapping(address => uint256) storage balances, address from, address to, uint amount) internal {
        require(balances[from] >= amount);
        require(balances[to] + amount >= balances[to]);
        balances[from] -= amount;
        balances[to] += amount;
    }
}

contract Token {
    mapping(address => uint256) balances;
    using Balances for *;
    mapping(address => mapping (address => uint256)) allowed;

    event Transfer(address from, address to, uint amount);
    event Approval(address owner, address spender, uint amount);

    function transfer(address to, uint amount) external returns (bool success) {
        balances.move(msg.sender, to, amount);
        emit Transfer(msg.sender, to, amount);
        return true;

    }

    function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint amount) external returns (bool success) {
        require(allowed[from][msg.sender] >= amount);
        allowed[from][msg.sender] -= amount;
        balances.move(from, to, amount);
        emit Transfer(from, to, amount);
        return true;
    }

    function approve(address spender, uint tokens) external returns (bool success) {
        require(allowed[msg.sender][spender] == 0, "");
        allowed[msg.sender][spender] = tokens;
        emit Approval(msg.sender, spender, tokens);
        return true;
    }

    function balanceOf(address tokenOwner) external view returns (uint balance) {
        return balances[tokenOwner];
    }
}
```
